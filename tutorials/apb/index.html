        <h1>Beginner's APB</h1>
        <p>APB (<Strong>A</Strong>thefre's <strong>p</strong>air & <strong>b</strong>lock) is a highlight algorithmic 3x3 method. This tutorial is going to teach a subset with slightly less algorithms (x as opposed to x, x% reduction)<br/><br/>
        This tutorial assumes that you at least know beginner's CFOP with intuitive F2l and 4LLL</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>6a. OCLL</li>
                <li>6b. PLL (1 or 2 look)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="block">1. 1x2x3 block</h2>
        <p>NOTE: There are more efficient ways of building a 1x2x3 block but since this tutorial is aimed at CFOP solvers, we'll be doing it the easy way.</p>
        <p>The first step of APB is to solve a 1x2x3 block (sort of like roux). You can do this any way, but the way I'll be showing is probably the easiest.
        The first thing you want to do is solve 1 cross edge:</p>
        <p>Then you'll create an F2L Pair and insert it (make sure it matches the cross edge!</p>
        <p>And then do the same for the pair on the other side.</p>
        <h2 id="dfdb">2. DF and DB edges</h2>
        <p>This step extends our 1x2x3 block into a 2x2x3 block. Turn the cube so that the block is on the left. Find the edge that needs to go into the DF edge (bottom one on the front), and set it up into one of the following cases:</p>
        <p>Turn the cube over so the block is now on the right (y2 rotation), and do the same but with these cases:</p>
        <h2 id="pair1">3. Pair creation</h2>
        <p>This step is pretty easy if you know intuitive F2L</p>
